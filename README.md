# Machine learning and statistics

Author: Jarlath Scarry

### Introduction
This repository contains my assignment for the Machine Learning and Statistics modulel of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics course at ATU 2023. 

It will contain:

– A README.md giving an executive summary of the purpose and
contents of the repository, and instructions for a competent
person to clone and run any code or notebooks in it.

– A .gitignore file to ignore any temporary files and folders
that should not normally be committed to a repository.

- Notebook containing 5 tasks:
    - Task 1. Square roots
    - Task 2. Chi-square test
    - Task 3. t-test
    - Task 4. 
    - Task 5.
 
 - Supporting materials


### How to use this repository

Notebooks are in jupyter notebook format. They appear as .ipynb file types. The most convinent way to view this file type is on the Jupyter notebooks viewer website [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/). 

<a href="https://nbviewer.org" target="_blank">nbviewer</a>

Right click on the notebook and "copy link address". Paste the address into the box and go! View the notebook and run the code.


### Tasks

Assessment throughout the simester involved working on 5 task notebooks. Task titles and a berif description are listed below.

Task 1. Square roots
Write a function sqrt(x) to approximate the square root of a floating point number x without using the power operator or a package.

Task 2. Chi-square test
Consider the contingency table given. Use scipy.stats to perform a chi-squared test to see whether there is any evidence of an association between the results.

Task 3.
Perform a t-test on the famous penguins data set3 to investigate whether there is evidence of a significant difference in the body
mass of male and female gentoo penguins.

Task 4.


Task 5.
