    "If we assume at the outset that there is no difference between the male and female mass, and take this to be k0, or the NULL hypothesis. If this is true what are the chances that the sample data we have would fit that hypothesis? From what we have seen it looks unlikley, but how to read that from the ttest results?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say this is very improbable, we need to set a treshold for this. If we say that the chances of seeing the different mass_means for the pair in our sample and the poplation overall having same mass_mean is very unlikley, could we put a value on that. Lets say there is a 5% chance of this being the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we can take it that a p-value of less than 5% (p-value<0.05) means the result is statistically significant. In otherwords we reject the NULL hypothesis and accept that the sample data is representitive of the overall population. That a Gentoo Penguins weight will likley vary depending on their sex. On the plots earlier we can see Males are generally heavier than females.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a p-value reported from a t test is less than 0.05, then that result is said to be statistically significant. If a p-value is greater than 0.05, then the result is insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the pvalue is signifficantly lower than 0.05 which indicates the result is statistically significant. The chance of seeing the sample we have in a population where there is no difference in Male and Female weights in very unlikley.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result (`pvalue=2.133687602018886e-28`) gives us strong enough evidence to reject the NULL hypothesis and say, yes there is likly to be a difference in the weight of a Gentoo penguin based on their sex. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ttest statistic value (`statistic=14.721676481405709`) tells us how much the sample mean deviates from the null hypothesis. I fthe statistic lies outside the quantiles of the t-distribution corresponding to our confidence level and degrees of freedom, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our t-statistic of 14.721676481405709 is well outside our range of -1.979930405052777 to 1.9799304050527766, so this is further evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis and reject the NULL hypothesis. \n"

It is a popular choice for machine learning beginners as it has good documentation and a broad library of functions. It is an excellent platform for learning. The package in python is actually called `sklearn`. This shorter name is helpful as it avoids confusion with extra charachters. It is generally included with annaconda so no need to install it seperatley.\n",

    "The scikit-learn `fit()` method is used to train or teach the learning model on a specific dataset. The model begins with default settings that may not be good at predicting the type of flower without any knowledge of flowers. Instead of using its previous knowlodge it learns the patterns in the data and uses those patterns to make predictions on new data. A training step with a fit method is required for most machine learning models before they can be used to make predictions."

Statistical tests have the advantage of making an objective judgement of normality, but are disadvantaged by sometimes not being sensitive enough at low sample sizes or overly sensitive to large sample sizes.
