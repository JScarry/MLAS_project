    "### Assumptions\n",
    "When you choose to analyse your data using a chi-square test for independence, you need to make sure that the data you want to analyse \"passes\" two assumptions. You need to do this because it is only appropriate to use a chi-square test for independence if your data passes these two assumptions. If it does not, you cannot use a chi-square test for independence. These two assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption #1: \n",
    "\n",
    "Your two variables should be measured at an ordinal or nominal level (i.e., categorical data). You can learn more about ordinal and nominal variables in our article: Types of Variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption #2: \n",
    "\n",
    "Your two variable should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. Example independent variables that meet this criterion include gender (2 groups: Males and Females), ethnicity (e.g., 3 groups: Caucasian, African American and Hispanic), physical activity level (e.g., 4 groups: sedentary, low, moderate and high), profession (e.g., 5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist), and so forth.\n",
