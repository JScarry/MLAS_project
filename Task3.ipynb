    "\n",
    ">A t-test is a type of statistical analysis used to compare the averages of two groups and determine whether the differences between them are more likely to arise from random chance. \n",
    "**It is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis.** It is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known (typically, the scaling term is unknown and is therefore a nuisance parameter). When the scaling term is estimated based on the data, the test statistic—under certain conditions—follows a Student's t distribution. The t-test's most common application is to test whether the means of two populations are different.\n",
    "\n",
    ">History\n",
    "The t-distribution, also known as Student's t-distribution, gets its name from William Sealy Gosset, who first published it in English in 1908 in the scientific journal Biometrika using the pseudonym \"Student\" because his employer preferred staff to use pen names when publishing scientific papers.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Although it was William Gosset after whom the term \"Student\" is penned, it was actually through the work of Ronald Fisher that the distribution became well known as \"Student's distribution\"\n",

    "#### What Is a T-Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    ">The t-distribution, also known as the Student’s t-distribution, is a type of probability distribution that is similar to the normal distribution with its bell. Unlike normal distributions, t- distribution has heavier tails, which result in a greater chance for extreme values.\n",
    "The t-distribution is used in statistics to estimate the significance of population parameters for small sample sizes or unknown variations.\n",
    "The t-distribution is the basis for computing t-tests in statistics.\n",
