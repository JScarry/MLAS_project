You need to do this because it is only appropriate to use a chi-square test for independence if your data passes these two assumptions. If it does not, you cannot use a chi-square test for independence. These two assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption #1:\n",
    "Your two variables should be measured at an ordinal or nominal level (i.e., categorical data). You can learn more about ordinal and nominal variables in our article: Types of Variable.\n",

    "Assumption #2:\n",
    "Your two variable should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. Example independent variables that meet this criterion include gender (2 groups: Males and Females), ethnicity (e.g., 3 groups: Caucasian, African American and Hispanic), physical activity level (e.g., 4 groups: sedentary, low, moderate and high), profession (e.g., 5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist), and so forth. These independent groups should not have any overlap. For example Tea or coffee drinker, Well sometimes I drink Tea, and sometimes Coffee. This is not accepted. The choice should be either or.\n",

Looking at the data it appears that somone chhosing Tea is more likley to choose a Chocolate biscuit, but we can check this with the Chi-squared test for independence. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume at the outset that there is no difference between whether a person likes Tea or Coffee with either Plain or Chocolate biscuits, and take this to be k0, or the NULL hypothesis. If this is true what are the chances that the sample data we have would fit that hypothesis? We need to set the treshold for this hypothesis. If we pass the treshold we reject the NULL hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we can take it that a p-value of less than 5% (p-value<0.05) means the result is statistically significant. In otherwords we reject the NULL hypothesis and accept that the sample data is representitive of the overall population. That if a person chooses Tea, they are likley to have a chocolate biscuit. Our p-value is far lower than 5% so we should accept the alternative hypothesis. In other words our assunption that the groups are independent is false based on out survey."
